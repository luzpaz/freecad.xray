## FreeCAD X-Rays Workbench

![X-Ray Workbench Logo](freecad/ship/resources/icons/XRay_Workbench.svg)

**Welcome to FreeCAD X-Rays!**

X-Rays is a module for [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) to simulate X-Rays.
To this end the module uses the Open Source Physically Based Renderer, [LuxCoreRender](https://luxcorerender.org)

For the time being the following tools are provided:

### X-Ray machine definition

![X-Ray Workbench Logo](freecad/ship/resources/icons/XRay_Workbench.svg)

Define your X-Rays scanner, providing the radiation spectrum, the rays
collimation angle and the scanning chamber dimensions.

### Objects materials

![XRay_ObjectAdd Icon](freecad/ship/resources/icons/XRay_ObjectAdd.svg)

Add objects with their custom non-linear attenuation factors. A bunch of presets
are provided from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-mass-attenuation-coefficients).

### Radiographies

Launch your simulation and let [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org) and
[National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/pml/x-ray-mass-attenuation-coefficients)
do the job for you to get a X-Ray projection.

## Install

Add [this repository](https://gitlab.com/sanguinariojoe/freecad.xray.git) to
your [Addon Manager](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Addon_manager) and install it.

## Usage

The documentation for this workbench is incoming!

## Roadmap

There are many tools and features which will be implemented in this module:

 - Wiki documentation
 - Tutorials
 - Tomographies
 - More scanners
   - Helical CT
   - Cone-Beam
 - Materials reflectivity

## Bugs/Enhancements

Please open tickets in the [issue queue](https://gitlab.com/sanguinariojoe/freecad.xray/-/issues)
